Just a basic or even primitive chatbot with no AI or cool stuff. I built this just for fun when Ä± was in college. Program takes keywords of your question and read 
related txt file to give you the answer. Just wanted to see what how simple it can be to build a primitive chatbot and yes it can be really simple as you see.
